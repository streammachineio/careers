# Is this you?
* You are a senior software engineer who writes, runs and loves your code. It's hard to specify an experience level as we don't know what you did in those N years. 
* You love K3: Kafka, Kotlin and Kubernetes.
* Streaming is not a new domain for you and you've had your fair share of serialization challenges (in e.g. Avro, Json Schema, Protobuf, etc)
* You know your way with REST, OpenAPI, and preferably GCP/AWS, gRPC, Terraform and Gradle.
* You're familiar with and prefer functional programming over a pure object oriented and declarative approach.
* You don't shy away from exploring and experimenting with new solutions and technologies to increase our performance. "Performance" to us is defined as the product of adoption, stability and awesome stack metrics (including distribution in a team through structured, well-tested and readable code). 
* You enjoy working together with our (prospective) customers as much as with your direct colleagues, both in production and concepting stages. 
* You value fun, honesty, directness, technical competence and enjoy being part of the rollercoaster of a startup with a deeply technical product and heart. 


# Our offer
We'll pay you to work on some of the coolest technologies we know. We're open to flexible and remote working arrangements - we currently have an office location in Utrecht NL (but COVID), and believe where you work should match the task at hand. Joining a young startup means you have the opportunity to purchase equity and ride along in more ways than just the adventure.

Most importantly, you'll be part of a challenging but fun and safe team focused on true performance in every sense.

# This is us
At Stream Machine, we're building a streaming data platform designed around privacy - so engineers and data scientists can "just build" innovative products with sensitive data, and get their managers' trust in doing so. 

Our stack is cloud-first and keywords are Kotlin, Kafka and Kubernetes. We run at significant scale and technical performance. To extend our small (but experienced!) team, we're looking for senior software engineers to develop and further extend our product(s) - from driver to deployment and from privacy to production.
