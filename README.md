At Stream Machine, we're engineering for the privacy age. 

We believe innovation and privacy can go together, and we're building a streaming data platform designed around privacy - so you (engineers and data scientists) can "just build" innovative products with sensitive data, and be trusted in doing so. 

Our stack is cloud-first and keywords are Kotlin, Kafka and Kubernetes. We run at significant scale and technical performance. 

Currently, we're hiring for:
* [Senior Software Engineer](https://github.com/streammachineio/jobs/blob/main/senior-software-engineer.md)
* Business Development Intern (text to follow)
